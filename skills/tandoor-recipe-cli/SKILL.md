## Tandoor CLI Skill

This skill provides AI agents with the ability to interact with a Tandoor Recipe Manager instance using the `tandoor-cli` command-line tool.

### Prerequisites

The `tandoor-cli` tool must be installed and configured.

**Version Compatibility:** This skill documentation corresponds to the version specified in the metadata above. Before using this skill:
1. Verify your installed CLI version: `tandoor -V`
2. Ensure the installed version matches the skill version to avoid unexpected behavior or missing commands
3. If versions don't match, reinstall the CLI tool following the setup instructions in `references/SETUP.md`

If `tandoor -V` produces no valid version, see the setup instructions in `references/SETUP.md`.

### Security & Permission Model

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This skill provides mutation authority over your Tandoor instance.**

- **Read operations** (list, search, get, random) are safe and require no confirmation
- **Write operations** (add, update, import) modify data but are typically reversible
- **Destructive operations** (delete, clear, household management) require explicit user approval before execution
- **Bulk operations** (shopping check --all, clear) affect multiple items and require confirmation
- **Administrative operations** (household management, user assignment, invite creation) require privileged credentials and explicit approval

**Token Security:**
- Use the **least-privileged token** possible for your use case
- Prefer read-only tokens if you only need to query recipes
- Avoid using space-owner or admin tokens unless household management is required
- Consider short-lived tokens (days/weeks) instead of long-lived tokens (years)
- Store tokens securely and rotate them regularly
- Revoke tokens immediately if compromised or no longer needed

**Supply Chain:**
- This skill uses the `tandoor-cli` npm package
- Verify the package source before first use: https://www.npmjs.com/package/tandoor-cli
- Review the package repository: https://github.com/dcenatiempo/tandoor-cli
- **Recommended:** Pin to the specific version matching this skill (see version in metadata above) to avoid unexpected updates
- Install pinned version: `npm install -g tandoor-cli@<version>` (replace `<version>` with the skill version)

| `shopping check --all` | Mark all items as checked | ✓✓ Explicit confirmation (bulk operation) |

#### Administrative Operations (Require Privileged Token + Explicit Confirmation)

**Important:** Tandoor uses **households** to organize users and recipes. Users are added to households via **invite links** — you cannot create users directly via the API.

> **Permission Requirements:** Household management commands require special permissions in Tandoor. Most operations need admin/staff privileges. The `household invite create` command specifically requires **space owner** authentication — even superusers or staff members will receive a 403 Permission Denied error if they're not the space owner. If you encounter permission errors, you must use the space owner's API token or contact your Tandoor administrator.

| Command | Description | Approval Required |
|---|---|---|
| `household add <name>` | Create a new household | ✓✓ Admin token + explicit confirmation |
| `household edit <id> --name <name>` | Rename a household | ✓✓ Admin token + explicit confirmation |
| `household delete <id> [--force]` | Delete a household | ✓✓ Admin token + explicit confirmation |
| `household users assign <user-space-id> <household-id>` | Assign user to household | ✓✓ Admin token + explicit confirmation |
| `household invite create <household-id> [--email EMAIL] [--expires DATE] [--group-id ID]` | Create invite link | ✓✓ Space-owner token + explicit confirmation |
| `household invite delete <id> [--force]` | Delete invite link | ✓✓ Admin token + explicit confirmation |

All read commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output suitable for agent pipelines.

### Agent Behavior Rules

**Before executing any command, the agent MUST:**

1. **For read operations:** Proceed without confirmation
2. **For write operations:** Describe the action and wait for user approval
3. **For destructive operations:** 
   - Clearly explain what will be deleted/modified
   - Warn that the action cannot be easily reversed
   - Wait for explicit user confirmation (e.g., "yes, delete recipe 42")
4. **For bulk operations:**
   - State how many items will be affected
   - Wait for explicit confirmation
5. **For administrative operations:**
   - Verify the user has provided an admin/space-owner token
   - Explain the scope of the change (e.g., "this will move user X to household Y")
   - Wait for explicit confirmation

**The agent MUST NOT:**
- Execute delete, force, bulk, household, invite, or user-assignment commands without explicit user approval
- Assume the user wants destructive actions even if implied by context
- Use `--force` flags without explicit user instruction
- Log or display the `TANDOOR_API_TOKEN` value in any output

### Configuration

The CLI supports three configuration methods (in precedence order):

1. **Environment variables** — `TANDOOR_URL` and `TANDOOR_API_TOKEN` in the current shell
2. **Config file** — `~/.config/tandoor-cli/config.json` (created by `tandoor configure`)
3. **`.env` file** — a `.env` file in the current working directory

Run `tandoor configure` once to save credentials interactively.

### Examples

**Configure credentials:**
```bash
tandoor configure
```

**Read example — list recipes as JSON:**
```bash
tandoor list --limit 5 --json
```

**Write example — create a recipe from a JSON file:**
```bash
# Agent should first ask: "I will create a new recipe from recipe.json. Proceed?"
# Only after user confirms:
tandoor add --json recipe.json
```

**Destructive example — delete a recipe:**
```bash
# Agent should first ask: "This will permanently delete recipe 42. This cannot be undone. Confirm deletion?"
# Only after explicit user confirmation:
tandoor delete 42 --force
```

**Image example — upload an image to a recipe:**
```bash
# Agent should first ask: "I will upload my-recipe-photo.jpg to recipe 42. Proceed?"
# Only after user confirms:
tandoor image 42 ./my-recipe-photo.jpg
```

**Household example — create a household and generate an invite link:**
```bash
# Agent should first ask: "I will create a new household named 'My Family'. This requires admin privileges. Proceed?"
# Only after user confirms:
tandoor household add "My Family"

# Agent should first ask: "I will create an invite link for household 1. This requires space-owner token. Proceed?"
# Only after user confirms:
tandoor household invite create 1 --email user@example.com --expires 2026-12-31
```

**Shopping list example — add items and check them off:**
```bash
# Agent should first ask: "I will add flour (500g) to the shopping list. Proceed?"
# Only after user confirms:
tandoor shopping add --food flour --amount 500 --unit g

# Agent should first ask: "This will mark ALL shopping items as checked. Confirm?"
# Only after explicit confirmation:
tandoor shopping check --all
```

**Cook log example — track when you cook a recipe:**
```bash
# Agent should first ask: "I will add a cook log entry for recipe 42 (4 servings, rating 5). Proceed?"
# Only after user confirms:
tandoor cooklog add --recipe 42 --servings 4 --rating 5

# Read example — list cook logs for a specific recipe:
tandoor cooklog list --recipe 42 --json

# Read example — find when you last had eggs:
tandoor cooklog ingredient eggs

# Read example — count how many times you had chicken last month:
tandoor cooklog ingredient chicken --startdate 2026-04-01 --enddate 2026-04-30

# Read example — find highly-rated egg recipes (4-5 stars):
tandoor cooklog ingredient eggs --min-rating 4

# Read example — find poorly-rated recipes from last month (1-2 stars):
tandoor cooklog list --startdate 2026-04-01 --enddate 2026-04-30 --max-rating 2

# Agent should first ask: "This will delete cook log entry 2. Confirm?"
# Only after explicit confirmation:
tandoor cooklog delete 2
```

### Installation & Setup

**Before first use:**
1. Verify the npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/tandoor-cli

3. **Recommended:** Install the pinned version matching this skill: `npm install -g tandoor-cli@<version>` (see version in metadata above)
4. Generate a token with minimal required permissions (see SECURITY.md)
5. Consider using a test Tandoor instance first
